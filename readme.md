Code is from [Mozilla findIndex() polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex).

1. Require the `npm` module.

```js
npm install --save-dev findindex_polyfill_mdn
```

2. Include the file before the usage.

Then you need to require the file on your `main.js` or where you are
going to plan to use the `find` function as follows:  

```js
require("findindex_polyfill_mdn")
```
